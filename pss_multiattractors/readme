This directory contains pictures of Pss for a two gene model (added Hill functions) with various parameter sets. Parameters were
chosen to obtain different number of (deterministic) stable states. 

Different combinations:

N attractors (N = 1, 2, 3, 4)
Additive or multiplicative
Noise amplitude (low, med, high)
Noise asymmetry (none, med, high)
